# Third party libraries that are included in the App Engine SDK must be listed
# here if you want to use them. See
# https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27 for
# a list of libraries included in the SDK. Third party libs that are *not* part
# of the App Engine SDK don't need to be listed here, instead add them to your
# project directory, either as a git submodule or as a plain subdirectory.
# Note that dependencies must be located in your project directory - packages
# installed in the Python environment are not loaded by the App Engine
# development server or deployment tools.
